# Software Engineer - XR - Rebecca Cofie

The XR experience can be accessed at https://rcofie.github.io/smartify/ - best viewed on mobile.

I mainly wrote the experience in JavaScript within an A-Frame component (see components.js) to showcase my JavaScript skills, as it was implied from the task description that the Smartify experiences are built in pure Three.js, so I wanted to demonstrate my skills in this area. For example, I loaded the GLB models directly in JavaScript. Another way to do it is to load the models within HTML A-Frame, and write the animations and interactions in the main.js file - which I have done previously.

Initially, I attempted to implement the WebXR Hit Test module and marker-based methods to detect the ground so the soil could be placed. These approaches were unsuccessful, so I prioritised animations and interactions to complete the experience. On reflection, using a raycasting method for ground detection would have been a better choice, and I would implement this if I had more time.

The UI design, which also includes an alternative concept for the game, can be viewed here: https://www.figma.com/design/DMOByzm2I1qlemqOuuL9gS/Sunflower-Seed---AR-Game.

# AR Developer/Creative Technologist task - "An astronaut walking into the sun"

The main code file to view is 'index.html'.

To play the demo experience, open up https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcofie/blippar-final/main/hiro.png on your computer. Open up https://rcofie.github.io/blippar-final/ on your phone and scan the Hiro image with your camera. Make sure your phone is on loud (not silent) to hear the background music.

The experience plays out smoothly for every scan of the marker preset. The only error is that when you take your phone off the marker image, the AR experience finishes, so you can't move your camera with the walking model. I tested it on my iPhone and it works on both Chrome and Safari (iOS 11+). I do not own an Android phone to test it on but I used the AR.js library which is compatible with both operating systems.
